# Phase Align in C

## Introduction

Phase Align is a lightweight C library for aligning signal phases in digital signal processing applications. This tool provides efficient algorithms for detecting and correcting phase differences between signals, which is essential in various fields such as audio processing, telecommunications, and scientific instrumentation. Phase alignment is critical for applications requiring precise bit addressing.

The library is written in C for maximum performance and portability, with minimal dependencies to ensure it can be easily integrated into existing projects.
